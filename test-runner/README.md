# Generic Test Runner

Test Runner is a simple automated testing framework for replicating and validating a user's command line interface experience with Intel AI Containers and Benchmarks.

## Quickstart

These steps assume you are using a modern Linux OS like [Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) with [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).

### Install Test Runner

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intel/ai-containers
pip install -r ai-containers/test-runner/requirements.txt
```

### Create Tests Definition File

```bash
touch tests.yaml
```

### Run test file

```bash
python ai-containers/test-runner/test_runner.py -f tests.yaml
```

1. Install the python requirements file
2. Create a `tests.yaml` [file](#create-tests-definition-file) in your project's test directory
3. Add a [test](#test-definition) to the `tests.yaml` file
4. [Run the Test Runner application](#run-test-file) command line interface to execute the test

### Test Definition

A test is defined as a set of commands to be executed along with their associated configurations. Each test is represented as an instance of the Test class, which has the following properties:

| Properties | Type           | Description  |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| name       | str            | The name of the test. |

#### Tests Definition Example

A sample minimal tests.yaml file will look like this:

```yaml
test_name:
  cmd: something -you <want|the|test_runner> --todo
```

### Advanced Tests

There are two more complex properties that can be enabled to provide additional functionality to your tests.

#### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set for a test by providing a dictionary of key-value pairs in the `env` property of the test definition. These environment variables will be set when the test is executed using the [`expandvars`](https://pypi.org/project/expandvars/) library.

Here's an example of a test definition using environment variables:

```yaml
test:
  cmd: echo "${VAR1:-hello}"
```

Execution:

```bash
python test-runner/test_runner.py -f path/to/tests.yaml
VAR1=world python test-runner/test_runner.py -f path/to/tests.yaml
```

In the example above, the first output will be `hello`, and the second output will be `world`.

Modifying the above example to use the `env` dictionary option:

```yaml
test:
  cmd: echo "${VAR1:-hello}"
  env:
    VAR1: "Yo!"
```

Execution:

```bash
python test-runner/test_runner.py -f path/to/tests.yaml
VAR1=world python test-runner/test_runner.py -f path/to/tests.yaml
```

In this instance, the default value of `hello` is overridden first by the value in the `env` variable dictionary, and then by the value passed on the test command line. Thus, the first output will be `Yo!`, and the second output will be `world`.

> [!TIP]
> It is a best practice to set a default value in the case where `VAR1` is not set with `:-<value>`, if the environment variable is not set for whatever reason, the test runner application will fail the test.

#### Masking

Masking is a feature that allows you to hide sensitive information in the logs generated by the test runner. This is useful when you want to prevent benchmark information from being publicly exposed.

To enbable masking, add the `mask` parameter to your `tests.yaml` file as a list of strings. Each string should be a key whose value you want to mask without any kind of delimiter.

By default, masking is enabled. To disable masking, add `"mask": [false]` to your `.actions.json` file.

```bash
python -f path/to/tests.yaml
```

```bash
test:
  cmd: echo "echo 'hello: world'"
  mask:
    - "hello"
```

In the example above, the output will be `hello:***`

#### Performance Thresholds

You can utilize performance thresholds stored in another github repository by providing the `PERF_REPO` environment variable in GitHub's `org-name/repo-name` format.

```yaml
test:
  cmd: "echo 'my-key: 100'"
  performance: perf/my-model:my-test-id
```

```bash
export PERF_REPO=...
python test-runner/test_runner.py -f path/to/tests.yaml
```

#### Notebook Test

A notebook test is a special type of test designed to run Jupyter notebooks. This is indicated by setting the notebook attribute to `True` in the test definition. When a test is marked as a notebook test, the command specified in the cmd attribute is expected to be [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) command. If papermill is not already installed in the provided `image` property, then it will be installed.

Here's an example of a notebook test definition:

```yaml
notebook_test:
  cmd: papermill --log-output my_notebook.ipynb result.ipynb
  img: jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
  notebook: true
```

In this example, `my_notebook.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that will be executed as the test using the `papermill` command line interface.

#### Serving Test

A serving test is a test that involves running a server and making requests to it. This is indicated by setting the serving attribute to `True` in the test definition. When a test is marked as a serving test, the command specified in the `cmd` attribute is expected to be run by a client `python:3.11` container. The image and entrypoint specified in the `img` and `entrypoint` properties are the server image and command you are attempting to test.

Here's an example of a serving test definition:

```yaml
serving-test:
  img: nginx:latest
  cmd: bash client_rest_test.sh
  entrypoint: nginx -g daemon off;
  serving: True
```

In this example, `client_rest_test.sh` is a bash script that executes `cURL` commands to the `nginx:latest` image. The test runner will start the server, and then execute the client commands.

## Usage

This application is designed to run a series of tests defined in a YAML configuration file. These tests can be run either directly on the host system (baremetal) or within a Docker container. The application can execute one test file using the command line interface.

```text
$ python test_runner.py --help
usage: test_runner.py [-h] [-a ACTIONS_PATH] -f FILE_PATH [-v] [-l LOGS_PATH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ACTIONS_PATH, --actions-file ACTIONS_PATH
                        -a /path/to/.actions.json
  -f FILE_PATH, --file FILE_PATH
                        -f /path/to/tests.yaml
  -v, --verbose         DEBUG Loglevel
  -l LOGS_PATH, --logs LOGS_PATH
                        -l /path/to/logs
```

### Run Modes

There are two modes for running the tests: baremetal and container.

#### Baremetal

In baremetal mode, the test command is executed directly on the host system. This mode is implied when the `img` key/value pair is not provided in the test definition.

Example of a test definition for baremetal mode:

```yaml
test1:
  cmd: echo "Hello, World!"
  env:
    VAR1: value1
    VAR2: value2
```

#### Container

In container mode, the test command is executed within a Docker container. This mode is used when the `img` attribute is provided in the test definition.

Example of a test definition for container mode:

```yaml
test2:
  cmd: echo "Hello, Docker!"
  img: ubuntu:latest
  volumes:
    - src: /host/path
      dst: /container/path
  env:
    VAR1: value1
    VAR2: value2
```

In this example, the echo command will be executed in an `ubuntu:latest` Docker container, with the `/host/path` directory on the host system mounted to `/container/path` in the container.

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

This composite action clones this repository just as in the [quickstart](#quickstart) section and runs the application on a given target `recipe_dir` directory.

Inputs for the action:

```yaml
  cache_registry:
    description: 'Container Cache Registry URL'
    required: false
    type: string
  perf_repo:
    description: 'Performance Test Repo'
    required: false
    type: string
  recipe_dir:
    description: 'Path to Recipe Directory'
    required: true
    type: string
  registry:
    description: 'Container Registry URL'
    required: false
    type: string
  repo:
    description: 'Container Repository'
    required: true
    type: string
  test_dir:
    description: 'Path to Test Dir'
    required: true
    type: string
  token:
    required: true
    type: string
```

See an [Example](../.github/workflows/test-runner-ci.yaml#L94) Implementation of the action.

> [!TIP]
> When writing Tests for use with a CI platform like GitHub Actions, write your tests in such a way that they would be executed from the root directory of your repository.

## Testing

For testing [tests.yaml](tests.yaml) file, some variables need to be set

```bash
export CACHE_REGISTRY=<harbor cache_registry_name>
export REGISTRY=<harbor registry>
export REPO=<harbor project/repo>
# optional
export PERF_REPO=<internal perf repo>
python test-runner/test_runner.py -f test-runner/tests.yaml -a test-runner/.actions.json
```
