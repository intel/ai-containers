# Intel® Distribution for Python*

[Intel® Distribution for Python*] enhances performance and can improve your program speed from 10 to 100 times faster. It is a Python* distribution that includes the [Intel® Math Kernel Library] (oneMKL) and other Intel performance libraries to enable near-native performance through acceleration of core numerical and machine learning packages.

## Images

The images below include variations for only the core packages in the [Intel® Distribution for Python*] installation, or all of the packages.

| Tag(s)                 | IDP        |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| `3.10-full`, `latest`  | `2024.2.0` |
| `3.10-core`            | `2024.2.0` |

## Run a Performance Sample

To run a performance sample run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intel/ai-containers
cd ai-containers/python
docker run --rm -it \
    -v $PWD/tests:/tests \
    intel/python:latest \
    python /tests/perf_sample.py
```

### Compare the results against stock python

In the previous command, you should see a result at the bottom like: `Time Consuming: 0.03897857666015625`. We can compare this against `python:3.11-slim-bullseye`

```bash
# Use the working directory from the above command
docker run --rm -it \
    -v $PWD/tests:/tests \
    python:3.11-slim-bullseye \
    bash
pip install numpy
python /tests/perf_sample.py
```

## Build from Source (Advanced)

To build the images from source, clone the [AI Containers](https://github.com/intel/ai-containers) repository, follow the main `README.md` file to setup your environment, and run the following command:

```bash
cd python
docker compose build idp
docker compose run idp
```

You can find the list of services below for each container in the group:

| Service Name | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `idp`        | Base image with [Intel® Distribution for Python*]                    |
| `pip`        | Equivalent python image without [Intel® Distribution for Python*]    |
