# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Intel® AI Containers! We welcome your help to make this project better.

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, submit a request to be added to the [Intel](https://github.com/intel) Organization on GitHub by contacting one of the [`ai-containers-maintain`](https://github.com/orgs/intel/teams/ai-containers-maintain) members.

Once assigned to the [`ai-containers-write`](https://github.com/orgs/intel/teams/ai-containers-write) or [`ai-containers-maintain`](https://github.com/orgs/intel/teams/ai-containers-maintain) team depending on the scope of your contributions, you will be able to create branches and submit pull requests.

Once you are added to the organization, you will be given acces to ai-containers' Azure Container Registry (ACR).

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please review it to understand the expectations for participant behavior.

### How to Contribute

1. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b username/your-feature`.
2. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), and [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   1. `pre-commit install`
   2. `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
   3. `sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv`
3. Follow the [Project Setup](README.md#project-setup) steps.
4. Install the third-party python dependencies necessary for pre-commit depending on the type of contribution you are making:
   1. Always install the documentation hook requirements: `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`.
   2. If you are contributing to Test Runner, run `pip install -r test-runner/dev-requirements.txt`.
   3. If you are contributing to helm charts, run `pip install -r workflows/charts/dev-requirements.txt`. Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) and then the [Chart Testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) tool.
5. Make your changes, commit, and [sign](#sign-your-work) your changes: `git commit -s -m 'Add your feature'`.
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin username/your-feature`.
7. Submit a pull request.

### Code Review

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult the [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests.

In order to complete the review process, the following steps are required:

1. All status checks pass.
2. All third-party dependencies are approved by the maintainers and no new vulnerabilities are introduced to the codebase.
3. At least one approval from a [codeowner](https://github.com/intel/ai-containers/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) that maintains the area of the code you are changing.

Depending on the size and complexity of the change, additional reviews may be required and it may be subject to additional requirements, for example, if you are submitting a contribution to [Test Runner](https://github.com/intel/ai-containers/tree/main/test-runner) you may be required to write unit tests that satisfy our coverage requirements.

### Merge Queue

Once your pull request has been approved, it will be added to the merge queue. The merge queue is a list of pull requests that are ready to be merged. The merge queue runs additional CI over your code to make sure no regressions were introduced into other areas of the codebase.

If your pull request passes the merge queue, it will be merged into the main branch. Otherwise, it will be removed from the merge queue, and you will need to address the issues that caused the failure.

## Contribution Guidelines
